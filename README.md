# openHop MeshCore Flasher

openHop MeshCore Flasher is a static, browser-based firmware flasher for loading openHop Modem firmware onto supported MeshCore-compatible devices. It runs entirely in the browser using Web Serial, so the website only needs static hosting over HTTPS.

The modem firmware variants are maintained in the openHop modem repository:

https://github.com/openhop-dev/openhop_modem

User documentation is available at:

https://docs.openhop.dev/projects/openhop-modem/flasher/

Firmware files are loaded directly from tagged upstream release folders. The version list is discovered from published GitHub releases and includes stable tags matching `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, starting with v1. Each version links to its GitHub release page.

## What it does

- Flashes ESP32-family devices with esptool.js.
- Supports normal ESP32 firmware updates.
- Supports Erase Device/full ESP32 flashing with bootloader, partition table, and firmware images when those files are available.
- Flashes nRF52 devices with serial DFU packages.
- Provides a serial console for supported devices.

## Firmware source

Firmware release history:

https://github.com/openhop-dev/openhop_modem/releases

The flasher configuration points at raw firmware files from each release tag. ESP32-P4 devices use the complete `firmware.factory.bin` at `0x0` because their bootloader starts at `0x2000`. Other ESP32 devices use the build-specific full-flash layout, commonly:

- `bootloader.bin` at `0x0`
- `partitions.bin` at `0x8000`
- `firmware.bin` at `0x10000`

For nRF52 devices, the flasher uses the variant's `firmware.zip` DFU package.
